* Black wallpaper

    % sudo sed -i 's/^theme.wallpaper.*/theme.wallpaper_cmd = { "xsetroot -solid black" }/' /usr/share/awesome/themes/default/theme.lua
    % awesome -k

  Need to reboot.  Simply restarting awesome isn't enough!
* Keybindings

Say I want to set the 'Function-F8' key to mean mute speakers.  In:
=~/.config/awesome/rc.lua= add an entry like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
awful.util.table.join(
---...
   awful.key({ modkey,           }, "F8", 
             function () 
                awful.util.spawn_with_shell("amixer -q set Master mute") 
   end), 
#+END_SRC
