# List Keys

```bash
$ gpg --list-keys
```

# Generate Key

```bash
$ gpg --gen-key
```

# Share your key

## Identify key-id

First we list the key we created to find out the **key-id**.

```bash
$ gpg --list-keys
/home/fenton/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
-------------------------------
pub   2048R/52449A8E 2011-12-21
uid                  Fenton Travers (Human Being) <fenton.travers@gmail.com>
sub   2048R/C1220815 2011-12-21
```

Notice the key-id is: **52449A8E** or the part after the slash on the
line beginning with **pub**

## Upload to KeyServer

http://pgp.mit.edu/

```bash
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 52449A8E
gpg: sending key 52449A8E to hkp server pgp.mit.edu
```

Goto: http://pgp.mit.edu/ and enter **fenton.travers@gmail.com** into
the __Search String__ input box in the __Extract a key__ section.

## Others get your key

Now ask your friend to import your key, and ask them to import your
key with:

```bash
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 52449A8E
gpg: requesting key 52449A8E from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
gpg: key 52449A8E: "Fenton Travers (Human Being) <fenton.travers@gmail.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
```

## Revoke Key

If u get a virus or some how your computer becomes compromised by
hackers, you'll want to revoke your key.

```bash
$ gpg --gen-revoke 52449A8E > revoke.txt
$ gpg --import revoke.txt 
gpg: key 52449A8E: "Fenton Travers (Human Being) <fenton.travers@gmail.com>" revocation certificate imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:    new key revocations: 1
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 52449A8E
gpg: sending key 52449A8E to hkp server pgp.mit.edu
```

Again search the pgp.mit.edu server to see that your key is revoked.

# Encryption

## Encryting your own data

If you want to encrypt a file that only you'll be able to unencrypt.

    $ gpg -r 8DE6C9FD -e email.txt

Where `8DE6C9FD` is the public key id of the person who you want to be
able to un-encrypt the file.  `email.txt` is the file we are
encrypting, change this to the file you want to encrypt.

## Unencrypt

If you want to un-encrypt data encrypted with your public key do:

   $ gpg -d email.txt.gpg

Where `email.txt.gpg` is the file that was encrypted with your public
key.
