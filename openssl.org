Buy a domain, use google apps to be the email server (MX records) for
the domain.  Certify ownership of the domain with StartSSL.  Send them
an CSR (see below), get a CA signed SSL certificate back from them.
This is like a public key that is verified to be from you.

Create a new key and Certificat Signing Request (CSR)

: openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout spicevan.com.key -out spicevan.com.csr

Send StartSSL the CSR: 

: spicevan.com.csr

They will return a file that after being unzip once and once again for
your server, in our case nginx, finally contains the file:

: 1_spicevan.com_bundle.crt

The below example is setting up SSL for nginx.

drop the two files: spicevan.com.key and 1_spicevan.com_bundle.crt

into /etc/nginx and set their permissions to 600

Your nginx.conf file's server section should have these values:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
server {
      listen       443 ssl;
      server_name  spicevan.com;
      ssl_certificate 1_spicevan.com_bundle.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key spicevan.com.key;
#+END_SRC
