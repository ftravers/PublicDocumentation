Trying to figure out how to setup NFC.  If you can get a NFC chip for
~ $0.10, then it's cost effective to provide these to people.

People could then have public/private key pairs stored on the key to
certify that they are who they say they are.

Adafruit uses the PN532 chip and have a breakout board for $40.
