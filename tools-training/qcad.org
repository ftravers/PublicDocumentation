* command line

** line

In command line box type:

=line [ENTER]=

next enter starting point, lets say we want to start at origin /0,0/

=0,0 [ENTER]=

now you can enter as many additional points as you like.

** points, coordinates

Points can be absolute *from the origin* as in: 

=10,10=

or they can be relative (@) *from the LAST point*, this example means
move 5 units in the =x= direction and 7 in the =y= direction.

=@5,7=

** point, angles

You can also use lengths and angles in absolute *from the origin* or
relative *from the last* point in the format: /length,angle/.  Draw a
point 20 units long at a 45 degree angle *from the origin*:

=20<45=

and relative to last point use =@=.  Example 5 units long at a 10
degree angle *from last point*:

=@5<10=

** rectangles

#+BEGIN_SRC 
rect [ENTER]
(first corner coordinate)
(second corner coordinate)
#+END_SRC
