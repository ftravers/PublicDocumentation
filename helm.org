| C-c p p   | Open Project      | Switch to Project                |
| C-c p e   | Recent            | Open recent files                |
| C-c p h   | Open Project File | Find file from Project Files     |
| A-y       | Yank              | Helm kill ring                   |

* Open file as root

Do: 

: C-x C-f

as usual, then navigate to file, then do:

: C-c r

* Search in Project Files

This will regex search in all files of a given project.  Very useful
to find uses of a defined function for example.

| C-c p f | show all *project* files in helm |
| A-a     | select all project files         |
| C-s     | grep through those project files |

Now you will have a list of matches, now you can save the matches

| C-x C-s | save matches to buffer |

Then inside the matches you can go to each match with:

| C-<up>/<down> | Go to match |

This keeps the grep window open so you can edit each occurance that
you find.

* Search whole project root

Search text of all files in Project dir

: C-c p s g

* remove projects from know project list

Delete: Alt-Shift-D
