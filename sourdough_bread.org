First you have to make sourdough starter from scratch if you dont have
starter.

100 gr whole wheat (or white) flour
100 gr water

Mix and clean rim of container.  Mold can grow on thin remains left
over on edge!  Cover with cloth.

** Feed/Wait cycles.

Remove crust formed on top, keep total of 100 grams.  Feed 50 gr H2O
and 50 gr flour.  Wait 48 hrs.  Repeat this step 2 more times.  

You may only need to discard crust created on top 1 time, after that
the yeast will 

Then reduce wait time to 24 hrs.  Repeat 3 more times.  

Reduce wait time to 12 hrs and repeat 4 times.  

Finally feed 3 x per day, for 2 days.

Your starter should be smelling like yoghurt and have bubbles in it.

You can now put in the fridge, your starter is started!
