Introduction
------------

The Oracle Containers for J2EE (OC4J) zip distribution provides
a complete J2EE 1.4 server environment distributed as a simple zip file.

The OC4J zip distribution includes an HTTP/S server, all of the required J2EE
1.4 APIs and services, a complete EJB 3.0 and JPA implementation,
Oracle TopLink, extensive Web Services capabilities and the browser-based
Application Server Control Console management interface to configure the server
and deploy applications.


Prerequisites
--------------

In order to use the OC4J zip distribution, a Java2 Standard
Edition (J2SE) SDK version 5.0 (or 1.4.2) must be installed on the host machine.


Extracting OC4J
---------------

Extract the oc4j_extended.zip file using  any archive utility which handles zip
files, including the jar utility in the J2SE.

<install-dir> is the directory into which the oc4j_extended.zip file was
extracted.

The following directory structure will be created:

    <install_dir>
        /ant
        /bin
        /diagnostics
        /j2ee
        /javacache
        /javavm
        /jdbc
        /jlib
        /lib
        /opmn
        /rdbms
        /sqlj
        /toplink
        /webservices
        /xqs


OC4J Command Script
-------------------

The OC4J zip distribution provides a script that can be used to start and stop a
local OC4J instance. The oc4j script is located in the <install-dir>/bin
directory.

    Usage: oc4j [Options]

The commands supported by the OC4J command script are:

    Usage: oc4j [Options]
    Options:

    -start                                           : start OC4J
    -shutdown -port <ORMI port> -password <password> : stop OC4J
    -version                                         : display the version
    -help                                            : display this message

Before using the OC4J command script, the following environment variables must
be set:

    ORACLE_HOME : directory where oc4j_extended.zip was extracted. = <install-dir>
    JAVA_HOME   : location of the J2SE SDK to be used.
    
    
Set up env. variables in unix:

$JAVA_HOME=/u01/app/java5/jdk1.5.0_22
$export JAVA_HOME
$env | grep JAVA_HOME

$ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oc4j-10131
$export ORACLE_HOME
$env | grep ORACLE_HOME

For example, if oc4j_extended.zip was extracted to /java/oc4j-10131 and the
J2SDK was installed in /java/j2se15 then JAVA_HOME and ORACLE_HOME would be set
as:

    JAVA_HOME=/java/j2se15
    ORACLE_HOME=/java/oc4j-10131


First Time Initialization
-------------------------

There are no specific tasks that need to be performed to ready the new OC4J
instance for use.  The new OC4J instance can be used immediately after the unzip
operation has completed.

** Note: on the first use of OC4J, you will be prompted to enter a password for
the OC4J administrator account. The username for this account defaults to
"oc4jadmin".

Change to the <install-dir>/bin  directory, and issue the following command:

    > cd <install_dir>/bin
    > oc4j -start

    Starting OC4J from /java/oc4j-10131/j2ee/home ...

    ... <application deployment messages >

    06/08/23 13:57:17 Set OC4J administrator's password (password text will not
    be displayed as it is entered)
    Enter password: ******
    Confirm password: ********
    The password for OC4J administrator "oc4jadmin" has been set.
    06/08/23 13:57:17  The OC4J administrator "oc4jadmin" account is activated.
    06/08/23 13:57:22 The OC4J administrator "oc4jadmin" account is activated.
    06/08/23 13:57:31 Oracle Containers for J2EE 10g (10.1.3.1.0) initialized

OC4J is configured with a set of defaults that includes a Web site from which
deployed applications and the management console can be accessed. These are
provided so OC4J can be started and used immediately without requiring
additional configuration tasks to be performed.


Starting and Stopping OC4J
--------------------------

The OC4J command script can be used to start and stop OC4J processes.

Start OC4J using the command script as follows:

    >cd <install_dir>/bin
    >oc4j -start

    Starting OC4J from /java/oc4j-10131/j2ee/home ...
    06/08/23 14:00:38 Oracle Containers for J2EE 10g (10.1.3.1.0)  initialized


Stop OC4J using the command script as follows:

    >cd <install_dir>/bin
    >oc4j -shutdown -port 23791 -password welcome

    Shutdown OC4J instance...

    Where :

    -port specifies the ORMI port in use with the local OC4J process.

    -password specifies the administration password entered as
     described in the "Basic Installation" section of this document.


Directly Starting and Stopping OC4J
-----------------------------------

In addition to the OC4J command script, it possible to directly start OC4J using
oc4j.jar on the command line.

Directly start OC4J server by changing to the J2EE_HOME directory and issuing
one of the following commands:

Option 1: Start OC4J using the default configuration files, which are located in
the j2ee/home/config directory.

    > cd <install_dir>/j2ee/home
    > java -jar oc4j.jar

Option 2: Start OC4J using a customized server.xml OC4J configuration file
located in a non-default directory (/mypath).

    > cd <install_dir>/j2ee/home
    > java -jar oc4j.jar -config /mypath/server.xml

The server outputs an initialization string with the version number when it is
ready to accept requests. For example:

    Oracle Containers for J2EE 10g (10.1.3.1.0) initialized

Stop OC4J using one of these methods:

- Use the "stop" button from within Application Server Control

- Use the shutdown command in the admin_client.jar command-line utility

- Press ^c (Ctrl+c) in the window where the process was started

- Use the process termination command (for example
"kill" on Unix/Linux) for the operating system in use.OC4J will indicate on the
console window that it is shutting down when it receives a shutdown signal.


Testing the OC4J Installation
-----------------------------

Test the installation by starting the OC4J instance and accessing the welcome
page from a Web browser.

    http://<oc4j_host>:8888

Where <oc4j_host> is the name of the server on which OC4J is running. The OC4J
welcome page will be displayed.

On the right hand side of the welcome page is a portlet with links to enable the
testing of the JSP and Servlet environments using standard examples.

If the default port number in the default-web-site.xml file has been changed,
access the Web server using :

    http://<oc4j_host>:<portnumber>

Where <portnumber> is the value specified in the "port" attribute of the
<web-site> element in the file.


Using Application Server Control Console
----------------------------------------

The OC4J zip distribution contains the JMX-based Application
Server Control Console, which enables you to perform server configuration tasks
as well as deploy and manage applications.

Application Server Control Console provides:

    + JSR-77 management and JSR-88 based deployment support
    + Extensive deployment support, including a comprehensive deployment
      plan editor
    + Configuration and management support for Web Services
    + An MBean browser for directly accessing OC4J System MBeans as well as
      application-specific MBeans
    + A JNDI browser

Application Server Control Console is configured to be auto-deployed when the
OC4J instance is started for the first time.

Application Server Control Console can be accessed using the URL:

    http://<oc4j_host>:8888/em

To logon to Application Server Control Console use the "oc4jadmin" username and
the password you set during the first initialization of OC4J.

Using the admin_client.jar Command-Line Utility
-----------------------------------------------

OC4J provides a command-line utility, admin_client.jar,that can be used to
perform operations on a running OC4J instance. Among other things, you can use
admin_client.jar to restart and stop OC4J, deploy applications, and configure
various resources. The admin_client.jar utility can operate
against OC4J instances running in a standalone mode or when in an Oracle
Application Server environment.

Note: the admin_client.jar utility is the replacement utility of the earlier
admin.jar.  It operates using the OC4J MBeans and the J2EE Deployment API. It
has a similar usage model to admin.jar but provides more comprehensive support
for deployment operations.

The admin_client.jar utility uses ORMI to connect to a running OC4J process. This
means OC4J must be started before using the utility. Note that OC4J can't be
started using admin_client.jar.

The admin_client.jar utility is exercised using the following command:

    > java -jar admin_client.jar <deployment URI> <admin_user> <admin_pwd>
      <command>

Usage Notes:

   - The deployment URI specifies the target OC4J on which to perform the
     specified command.  A deployment URI can be one of three forms

     OC4J Standalone:

         deployer:oc4j:hostname:ormi_port

         deployer:oc4j:localhost:23791

         deployer:oc4j:localhost (defaults to 23791)

     Oracle Application Server - Single Instance:

         deployer:oc4j:opmn://opmn_host:opmn_port/oc4jInstanceName

         deployer:oc4j:opmn://localhost:6003/home

         deployer:oc4j:opmn://localhost/home (defaults to 6003)

     Oracle Application Server - Group:

         deployer:cluster:opmn://opmn_host:opmn_port/groupName

         deployer:cluster:opmn://localhost/Colors

   - The admin_user should be specified as "oc4jadmin" by default.

   - The admin_pwd is the "oc4jadmin" account password you configured
     during the first time initialization of the OC4J instance.

Use the -help option see all of the available admin_client.jar commands.

    > java -jar admin_client.jar -help

Use the -usage <command> option to see detailed information for a specific
command.

    > java -jar admin_client.jar -usage <command>

    > java -jar admin_client.jar -usage deploy
