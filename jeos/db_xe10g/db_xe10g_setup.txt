db0.tar.gz
	This is clean database that has nothing in it.


	Summary
	What: Oracle DB XE 10.2
	OS: OEL5U3 64bit
	Zipped Size	486 MB
	Unzipped Size on disk	4.3 GB
	RAM	512 (when idle 170MB to spare)
	Free Disk Space	1.2 GB
	Root Password	ovsroot
	
	Build Procedure
	Oracle XE JeOS Image Build
	An Oracle XE image is pretty much going to be the foundation of any packaging I create. Right now my focus is on developers not production so I use XE instead of the full-blown Oracle DB. However, eventually I would have a separate full-blown Oracle DB image for production deployment.
	After some experimentation I have settled on building the following base image
	•	No added packages
	•	System disk size of 2300 MB (leaves us with about 1.5 GB for database data)
	•	Swap 1024 MB
	•	RAM 512
	  After I got the basic system up I needed to do a few additional things.
	Remove Firewall
	Remove the firewall for now.
	# chkconfig --del iptables
	 IP address and hostname
	Make sure your hostname and ipaddress are what you want them to be in: 
	# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
	HOSTNAME=db5
	IPADDR=192.168.8.114
	# cat /etc/hosts
	127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost db5
	Make the changes stick
	# service network restart
	Install prerequisite packages
	Install the required prerequisite 
	# yum install –y libaio 
	# yum install -y bc
