>>> USE CASE: Automatic login with no password required for ssh <<<

Description: Often it is a pain in the ass to have to remember and also simply to enter your password when logging into a server.  With the following steps we show how to automate this process

=> create a private/public key pair on your computer
=> copy the public key to the /root dir on the server you want to login automatically as root to
=> ssh as root to that server you should be in the '/root' directory
=> execute the following command:
[root@hp2 ~]# cd .ssh; cat ../id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys; chmod 600 authorized_keys
=> exit and log back in and see no password is now required

===================================================================
>>> USE CASE: Change port SSH runs on <<<

[root@hp2 ~]# chkconfig --del iptables; service iptables stop
[root@hp2 ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

uncomment port line and then have two lines one for port 22 and one for your custom port.

[root@hp2 ~]# service sshd reload
[root@hp2 ~]# exit
mac:svn traversfenton$ ssh root@hp2
ssh: connect to host hp2 port 22: Connection refused
mac:svn traversfenton$ ssh root@hp2 -p 10322
