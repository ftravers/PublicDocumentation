The following link will help you with getting OVMS(Oracle Virtual
Machine Server) and OVMM(Oracle Virtual Machine Manager)

h1. Intro

These are _rapid_, _reference_ install instructions.  I refer to these
directions each time I setup a new VM.  They are not meant as a
tutorial, though as I begin to share these with other people that will
probably become more necessary and they may change to reflect that.

This document is used after you have create a new VM in OVMM or OVM
Template Builder.  After you've created that template there are some
basics that all future VM's need and that is what this document is
about.  We set the IP address, hostname, gateway, dns, etc..., plus a
few other required things.

It's best that the machine be able to see the internet.

h1. Setup

h2. Start VM

You'll be extracting your VM to the folder: @/OVS/running_pool/@

Make sure you have a folder under that folder that contains files like:

bc. 
system.img
vm.cfg

Althought @system.img@ could be called anything, and probably @vm.cfg@
could be too but these are the conventions.  Edit @vm.cfg@ and make
sure that the references to the disk images have the correct paths.

Ensure you are in the folder with the vm files noted above and start
the vm with: @xm create vm.cfg@

h2. VNC in

please see: "Setting Up Virtual Machine Lab - VNC in.":/jeos/SettingUpVirtualLab.html#vncin

h1. NFS Mount

You can NFS mount a folder on your VM Server by following "these instructions":/training/linux.html#nfs

----------


Sometimes you'll need to create and attach a shared disk to your image.
I needed this to copy install files onto the image, but after the install
I don't need or want all that extra disk.  Instructions below indicate
how to achieve this.

You only need to run fdisk and mkfs once per shared disk, don't run it each time you mount 
the shared image to one VM or another one.


Create a shared disk in OVM Manager:
	Resources > Shared Virtual Disks > Create Shared Virtual Disk

Specify the details required.  Eventually you'll have a device name like: xvdc

----------------------------------------------

bc. 
# dd if=/dev/zero of=stellent.img bs=1M count=2048
xm block-attach <vm_name> file:<path_to_file> <device> w 
xm block-attach db112 file:/OVS/running_pool/db112/data.img xvdc w  
 
2048 * 5 = 10240

Inside the running VM do the following steps.  Run fdisk with the device:

bc. 
# fdisk /dev/xvdc


You'll get some error messages saying you don't have a valid partition table. 

* Create a new partition, 

bc. 
'n', 'p', '1', <enter>, <enter>, 't', '8e' 'w'.

* Format the file system

bc. 
# mkfs -t ext3 /dev/xvdc
	
* Create a mount point

bc. 
# mkdir /u02

* Add it to /etc/fstab

bc. 
[root@db11g u01]# cat /etc/fstab
/dev/xvdc		/u02			ext3	defaults	1 2
	
* Issue the mount all command:

bc. 
[root@db11g u01]# mount -a
	
-----------------------------------------------
	
You can mount the disk with the following command: (format: mount <device> <directory>)
	# mkdir /u02; mount /dev/xvdc /u02
	
	
Then in /etc/fstab add a line like:
	/dev/xvdc /u02 ext3 defaults 1 2


Mount the volume
	# mount -a
	
To no longer have the volume be part of this image just remove
from /etc/fstab and reboot.

-------------------------------------------------
Install Java SDK
> Download the bin version not the rpm version.
> as the oracle user, create a folder: /u01/java and drop the bin file into there.
> chmod it to be able to execute then execute bin file:
	[oracle@op4 java]$ chmod 755 jdk-1_5_0_22-linux-i586.bin 
	[oracle@op4 java]$ ./jdk-1_5_0_22-linux-i586.bin 
	
------------------------------------------------
setup time and timezone

[root@opel ~]# cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/
[root@opel Asia]# ln -sf ./Kuala_Lumpur /etc/localtime
[root@opel ~]# ntpdate pool.ntp.org
