you must put an iso image onto the vm server.  put the iso on an ftp file server and then import it with OVM Manager.

Now install from this iso.

Install .net framework 2.0.  Find file here: 

software/oracle/Linux and Virtual Machine/OVM/dotnetfx.exe

use remote desktop from Mac and change Remote Desktop preferences/display to full screen.

Install PV drivers from same location above.

To VNC into this machine must use another windows box: Chicken of the VNC doesn't work together with WinXP OVM.

!!!!! After I install the above dotnetfx.exe, then I try to install the PV drivers, I get a blue screen of death.

==> Try to find a more recent .net framework (many don't seem to install, the above did so I thought I would be in good shape...but unfortunately I wasn't.)
