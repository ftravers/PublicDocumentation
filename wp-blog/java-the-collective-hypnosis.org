#+TITLE: The Duke wears no clothes!

I was born in 1973, which made me a Java devotee.  Now 40 years later,
and 15 years spent in the Java cult, I'm finally emerging from from
the stupor of that collective hypnosis.  At the time of my
induction, I was clueless to programming history, and my world was
shaped by a distaste for all things Microsoft.  Java seemed like the
righteous path, breaking platform lock-in.  It was easier than C++
with garbage collection.
