## Getting Started

First you want to get your clojure development environment setup.  

* [Clojure Development Setup](clojure-development-setup.md)

* [Reference](clojure.md)

## XML

Next I needed to learn how to work with XML

* [Reading XML](clojure-read-xml.md)

* [Writing XML](clojure-write-xml.md)

## Misc

* The [thread](clojure-thread.md) (first/last/thrush) operators: `->` `->>`
