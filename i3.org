* misc

Config file:

`~/.i3/config`

| Keys     | Effect                 |
|----------+------------------------|
| WK-S-A-e | stop i3 window manager |
| WK-S-q   | hard kill window       |
| WK-S-r   | restart                |
| WK-S-A-c | reload                 |

Change the modifier key to `Alt`:

    set $mod Mod1

Mod1 = Alt, Mod4 = Windows Key.

* startup

In workspace 10, start urxvt, then move to workspace 1:

    exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 10; exec urxvt; workspace 1'

* status

ref: http://i3wm.org/i3status/manpage.html

config file: ~/.i3status.conf

battery files on ss9: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1

```
$ cat capacity 
74
$ cat energy_now 
4400000
$ cat energy_full
5880000
```

For some reason cannot get battery info, so i3status has a mechanism
to write your own status bar stuff...

```
#!/bin/sh
# shell script to prepend i3status with more stuff

i3status | while :
do
        read line
        echo "mystuff | $line" || exit 1
done
```

Put that in some script, say `.bin/my_i3status.sh` and execute that
instead of i3status. 

Note that if you want to use the JSON output format (with colors in
i3bar), you need to use a slightly more complex wrapper script. There
are examples in the contrib/ folder, see
http://code.i3wm.org/i3status/tree/contrib
