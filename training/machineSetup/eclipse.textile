h2. Get m2e full text indexing

To get Maven working so that it will lookup the dependencies for class names, do:

open the "Maven Repositories" view
right click on "Global Repositories" / "central (http://repo1..." node
click on "Full Index Enabled" (and wait for a long time while eclipse stops responding)
then the "Search class in Maven repositories" and "Select Goal" dialogs start working
