How to use the One Silver Sea computer lab.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> SECURE SHELL <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

==> Getting Required Tools

The first thing that you need is a functional Secure Shell (SSH) client. Both
the Mac and Linux come with built-in command line shells. For Windows I
recommend the use of Cygwin. There are other clients that you can use such as
Putty. The reason I prefer Cygwin is because it also provides all the other
utilities associated with Linux. We will make use of some of these other
utilities.

Try to install Cygwin when you are at home as opposed to being connected to
the Oracle network via VPN or at the Oracle office. You can do it at the
Oracle office but you need to be on the clear guest network. The reason for
this caveat is that some port that Cygwin uses is blocked on the Oracle
network.

Two tools that he will also use are open SSH and rsync. Make sure when you
install Cygwin that these two tools are also installed.

==> Connecting to the servers with SSH

The first thing that you will be doing is secure shelling into the servers.
The command to do this looks like this:

template: ssh <username>@<host> -p <port>
example:  ssh root@test.ftravers.com -p 10222

This will then prompt you for your password, supply it and you will be logged
in.

The lab currently consists of three Oracle virtual machine servers they are
located at the following ports for SSH:

Name: x61, Host: test.ftravers.com, Port: 10222
Name: hp4, Host: test.ftravers.com, Port: 10322
Name: hp2, Host: test.ftravers.com, Port: 10422


>>>>>>>>>>>>>> VIRTUAL MACHINES <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

==> Displaying, stopping and starting Virtual Machines.  Command Line

You can see which virtual machines are running pontes virtual machines servers
by issuing the command:

xm list

The virtual machines are all located under the folder:

/OVS/running_pool

To stop a virtual machine issue the command:

xm shutdown <vm_name>

Where <vm_name> is the name that was displayed by the command 'xm list'. To
start a virtual machine you can execute the command:

xm create <path_to_vm.cfg_file>

For example you may change your directory to something like: 

/OVS/running_pool/bpel

Inside this directory there will be the file vm.cfg so to start this virtual
machine you simply would execute the following command:

xm create vm.cfg

==> Backing up VM's
Shutdown the VM.  Copy the directory containing the VM.  Done.

==> Displaying, stopping and starting Virtual Machines.  Web Admin Console Line

Starting and stopping virtual machines can also be done from an administrative
panel. Currently, the administrative Web console is running in his own virtual
machine on the hp4 virtual machine server.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> FIREWALLS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You will often be setting up services that make use of certain ports on your
computer so it's important to understand how to configure the firewall on that
server to allow those ports to be open without turning off the firewall
completely.

To add a new port, run the following and

 [root@hp2 ~]# /usr/bin/system-config-securitylevel

Choose Customize, add a line like: 8888:tcp to the beginning other ports
section, OK, OK.
