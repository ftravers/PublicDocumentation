Glossary:

	Entity Objects:
An entity object is a java object (instantiated) that represents one row of a database table.  There are some nuances here but principally think of it as the same thing as a database row...just in java code so you can work with it.

	View Objects:
Gives a “view” of your data. Define which attributes are “visible”. Set filter criteria: Order by, Where. Can query data from one or more tables. Implement master/detail coordination. Defined in XML. Java can be exposed as needed.

	Application Modules
Consists of one or more view objects. Handles the connection with the database. Handles the database transaction. Defined in XML. Java can be exposed as needed

	Data Controls

	Managed Bean
This is a java class that is 'behind' a given jsp/f page that helps with all the interactions between the elements on the page.
For example you might want to click a button and copy the text from one cell to another cell.  This can be accomplished
with the managaged 'backing' bean.
