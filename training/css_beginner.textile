In your html page put the following line somewhere in between the <head></head> tags.

<LINK REL=StyleSheet HREF="style.css" TYPE="text/css"/>

Now, create a separate new file called _style.css_ in the same folder as your html page.  Do this by right clicking your project and choosing _New_ > _File_.

Name the file _style.css_, then click _Finish_.

Now inside your style.css file put the following command.

bc. 
p {
	color: red;
}

Then save the file.  

Now go back into your html file and type the following text:

bc. 
<p>Hello</p>

Save your html file and go back to your browser window and refresh the window.
