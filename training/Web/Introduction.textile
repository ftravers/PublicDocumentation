h1. Introduction

This document will guide you to the resources that will enable you to develop modern dynamic web sites.  The first thing you need to do is to learn basic HTML and CSS.  Checkout:

* "Learn HTML & CSS using an online text editor (Bespin)":bespin.html 

Also use the following two links as references for "HTML":html5.html and "CSS":css.html

Getting use to the above should take you 1 week part time...that is probably 2 nights for 2 hours each.  Once you are quite comfortable there, we can go on to more advanced topics.


h2. Under Construction

The remainder of this page is under construction so please ignore for now.

The first thing you need to do is setup an environment where you can try building these websites.  Follow "this document":../javaEE6/FirstTimeSetup.html to get your environment setup.  You can use a Windows, Mac, or Linux system to do your development.
