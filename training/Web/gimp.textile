h1. Glossary

h2. Alpha Channel

An image can contain information about how transparent each pixel is.  Typically an 8 bit number for each pixel, with 255 meaning totally opaque (visible) and zero meaning totally transparent (invisible).  This set of data is called the Alpha Channel.  

h2. Alpha to Selection

Gimp allows you to create a selection from the Alpha Channel.  From the manual: "The Alpha to Selection command creates a selection in the current layer from the alpha channel, which encodes transparency. Opaque areas are fully selected, transparent areas are unselected, and translucent areas are partially selected. This selection replaces the existing selection. The alpha channel itself is not changed."

h2. Copy + Paste => New Layer

Make a selection, choose @Ctrl-c@, then hit @Ctrl-v@, now click on the layer icon.  This converts the copy and pasted floating layer into a normal layer.

When you copy and paste, as you are pasting you can't really see what you are pasting, so it seems akward to align it.  Just paste it and create a new layer as specified in the previous paragraph.  Then use the move tool (press m key) to move/align the pasted layer.

h2. Multiple selections

Use the @Shift@ key to make multiple selections.
