h1. Getting Started

h2. Code & Data modes

The Lisp compiler uses two modes when it reads your code: 

* A Code Mode and a 
* Data Mode. 

When you're in Data Mode, you can put anything you want into your
lists. However, the compiler first starts off reading your code in
Code Mode.

In Code Mode, your lists need to be a special type of list called a
form:

bc. (command param1 param2 param3 ... )

A form is a list where the first symbol in the list has to be a
special word that the compiler can understand- Usually the name of a
function. In this case, the compiler will send the other items of the
list to the function as parameters. When it reads the text for these
parameters, it will usually assume that they are also in Code Mode,
unless you tell it to flip into data mode.

bc. (setf *objects* '(whiskey-bottle bucket frog chain))
                    
Ok, now let's dissect this line an see what it means: Since a Lisp
compiler always starts reading things in Code Mode and expects a form,
the first symbol, setf, must be a command. In this case, the command
sets a variable to a value: The variable is @*objects*@ (Lispers like to
put stars around the names for global variables as a convention) and
the value we are setting it to is a list of the four objects. Now,
since the list is data (i.e. we don't want the compiler to try and
call a function called whiskey-bottle) we need to "flip" the compiler
into Data Mode when reading the list. The single quote in front of the
list is the command that tells the compiler to flip:

!lisp_flipDataMode.jpg!

h3. Flip, flop

bc. 
(defun describe-path (path)
  `(there is a ,(second path) going ,(first path) from here.))

Ok, now this function looks pretty strange: It almost looks more like
a piece of data than a function.

Now when we look at the function again, we can see that the function
"looks" a lot like the data it produces: It basically just splices the
first and second item from the path into a declared sentence. How does
it do this? It uses back-quoting!

Remember that we've used a quote before to flip the compiler from Code
Mode to Data Mode- Well, by using the the back-quote (the quote in the
upper left corner of the keyboard) we can not only flip, but then also
flop back into Code Mode by using a comma:



h2. Functional Programming Definition

The Functional Programming Style

You may have noticed that our describe-location function seems pretty
awkward in several different ways. First of all, why are we passing in
the variables for location and map as parameters, instead of just
reading our global variables directly? The reason is that Lispers
often like to write code in the Functional Programming Style (To be
clear, this is completely unrelated in any way to the concept called
"procedural programming" or "structural programming" that you might
have learned about in high school...). In this style, the goal is to
write functions that always follow the following rules:

1. You only read variables that are passed into the function or are
created by the function (So you don't read any global variables)

2. You never change the value of a variable that has already been set
(So no incrementing variables or other such foolishness)

3. You never interact with the outside world, besides returning a
result value. (So no writing to files, no writing messages for the
user)

In emacs execute:

bc. Alt-x slime

h1. Commands

h2. Printing

bc. (format t "hello, world")

Format directives start with ~ (much the way printf’s directives start
with %).

The ~t directive is for tabulating. The ~10t tells FORMAT to emit enough spaces to move to
the tenth column before processing the next ~a. A ~t doesn’t consume any arguments.

CL-USER>  (format t "~a:~10t~a" :artist "Dixie Chicks")
ARTIST:   Dixie Chicks
NIL

Now things get slightly more complicated. When FORMAT sees ~{ the next
argument to be consumed must be a list. FORMAT loops over that list,
processing the directives between the ~{ and ~}, consuming as many
elements of the list as needed each time through the list.

In dump-db, the FORMAT loop will consume one keyword and one value
from the list each time through the loop. The ~% directive doesn’t
consume any arguments but tells FORMAT to emit a newline. Then after
the ~} ends the loop, the last ~% tells FORMAT to emit one more
newline to put a blank line between each CD.

bc. 
(defun dump-db ()
 (dolist (cd *db*)
  (format t "~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%" cd)))


You can also see the current value of @*db*@ whenever you want by typing @*db*@ at the REPL.

bc. 
CL-USER> *db*
((:TITLE "Home" :ARTIST "Dixie Chicks" :RATING 9 :RIPPED T)
 (:TITLE "Fly" :ARTIST "Dixie Chicks" :RATING 8 :RIPPED T)
 (:TITLE"Roses" :ARTIST "Kathy Mattea" :RATING 7 :RIPPED T))

Technically, you could have also used FORMAT to loop over the database
itself, turning our dump-db function into a one-liner.

bc. 
(defun dump-db ()
(format t "~{~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%~}" *db*))

h2. User Input

h3. Streams

h4. Out

t is shorthand for the stream *standard-output*

h4. In

The variable *query-io* is a global variable (which you can tell
because of the * naming convention for global variables) that contains
the input stream connected to the terminal.


h3. Strings 

The variable *query-io* is a global variable (which you can tell
because of the * naming convention for global variables) that contains
the input stream connected to the terminal.

bc. 
(defun prompt-read (prompt)
 (format *query-io* "~a: " prompt)
 (force-output *query-io*)
 (read-line *query-io*))

Note that there’s no ~% in the format string, so the cursor will stay
on the same line. The call to FORCE-OUTPUT is necessary in some
implementations to ensure that Lisp doesn’t wait for a newline before
it prints the prompt.

Then you can read a single line of text with the aptly named READ-LINE
function.

h3. Integers

prompt-read returns a string, what about numbers/booleans?

bc. (parse-integer (prompt-read "Age"))

Unfortunately, the default behavior of PARSE-INTEGER is to signal an
error if it can’t parse an integer out of the string or if there’s any
non-numeric junk in the string. However, it takes an optional keyword
argument :junk-allowed, which tells it to relax a bit.

bc. (parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating") :junk-allowed t)

But there’s still one problem: if it can’t find an integer amidst all
the junk, PARSE-INTEGER will return NIL rather than a number. In
keeping with the quick-and-dirty approach, you may just want to call
that 0 and continue. Lisp’s OR macro is just the thing you need
here. It’s similar to the “short-circuiting” || in Perl, Python, Java,
and C; it takes a series of expressions, evalu- ates them one at a
time, and returns the first non-nil value (or NIL if they’re all
NIL). So you can use the following:

bc. (or (parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating") :junk-allowed t) 0)

h3. Conditionals, Booleans

h4. if

bc. (if <condition> <do this if true> <do this if false>)

h4. or

Lisp’s OR macro is just the thing you need here. It’s similar to the
“short-circuiting” || in Perl, Python, Java, and C; it takes a series
of expressions, evalu- ates them one at a time, and returns the first
non-nil value (or NIL if they’re all NIL).

h4. t

@t@ = Lisp’s version of truth


Fixing the code to prompt for Ripped is quite a bit simpler. You can just use the Common
Lisp function Y-OR-N-P.

bc. (y-or-n-p "Ripped [y/n]: ")

Putting it all together:

bc. 
(defun prompt-for-cd ()
 (make-cd
 (prompt-read "Title")
 (prompt-read "Artist")
 (or (parse-integer (prompt-read "Rating") :junk-allowed t) 0)
 (y-or-n-p "Ripped [y/n]: ")))

h2. File I/O

h3. Write to file

The @WITH-OPEN-FILE@ macro opens a file, binds the stream to a variable,
executes a set of expressions, and then closes the file. It also makes
sure the file is closed even if something goes wrong while evaluating
the body. The list directly after @WITH-OPEN-FILE@ isn’t a function call
but rather part of the syntax defined by @WITH-OPEN-FILE@. 

@out@ = It contains the name of the variable that will hold the file stream to
which you’ll write within the body of @WITH-OPEN-FILE@,

@filename@ = a value that must be a file name,

and then some options that control how the file is
opened. Here you specify that you’re opening the file for writing with
@:direction :output@ and that you want to overwrite an existing file of
the same name if it exists with @:if-exists :supersede@.

Once you have the file open, all you have to do is print the contents
of the database with @(print *db* out)@. Unlike @FORMAT, PRINT@ prints
Lisp objects in a form that can be read back in by the Lisp
reader. The macro @WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX@ ensures that certain
variables that affect the behavior of @PRINT@ are set to their standard
values. You’ll use the same macro when you read the data back in to
make sure the Lisp reader and printer are operating compatibly.

bc. 
(defun save-db (filename)
 (with-open-file (out filename
  :direction :output
  :if-exists :supersede)
 (with-standard-io-syntax
 (print *db* out))))

h3. Read from file

bc. 
(defun load-db (filename)
 (with-open-file (in filename)
 (with-standard-io-syntax
 (setf *db* (read in)))))

This time you don’t need to specify :direction in the options to
WITH-OPEN-FILE, since you want the default of :input. And instead of
printing, you use the function READ to read from the stream @in@.

The @SETF@ macro is Common Lisp’s main assignment operator. It sets its first argument to
the result of evaluating its second argument. So in @load-db@ the @*db*@ variable will contain the
object read from the file, namely, the list of lists written by save-db. You do need to be careful
about one thing—load-db clobbers whatever was in @*db*@ before the call. So if you’ve added
records with add-record or add-cds that haven’t been saved with save-db, you’ll lose them.

h2. List Processing 

h3. REMOVE-IF-NOT

The function @REMOVE-IF-NOT@ takes a predicate and a list and returns a list containing only
the elements of the original list that match the predicate. In other words, it has removed all the
elements that don’t match the predicate. However, @REMOVE-IF-NOT@ doesn’t really remove
anything—it creates a new list, leaving the original list untouched. 

bc. 
CL-USER> (remove-if-not #'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
(2 4 6 8 10)

h3. Passing functions as parameters

In this case, the predicate is the function EVENP, which returns true if its argument is an
even number. The funny notation #' is shorthand for “Get me the function with the following
name.” Without the #', Lisp would treat evenp as the name of a variable and look up the value
of the variable, not the function.

h3. Anonymous functions (lambdas)

You can also pass REMOVE-IF-NOT an anonymous function. For instance, if EVENP didn’t
exist, you could write the previous expression as the following:

bc. 
CL-USER> (remove-if-not #'(lambda (x) (= 0 (mod x 2))) '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
(2 4 6 8 10)

In this case, the predicate is this anonymous function:

bc. (lambda (x) (= 0 (mod x 2)))

h3. mapcar

mapcar simply applies another function to every object in the list

h3. DOLIST

The @DOLIST@ macro works by looping over all the elements of @*db*@ with
the @DOLIST@ macro, binding each element to the variable cd in turn. For
each value of cd, you use the @FORMAT@ function to print it.

bc. 
(defun dump-db ()
 (dolist (cd *db*)
  (format t "~{~a:~10t~a~%~}~%" cd)))

h2. Other Commands

h3. Define a new function

bc. (defun <function_name> <paren_list> <function>)

h3. Keyword Functions

In the functions you’ve written so far, you’ve specified a simple list
of parameters, which are bound to the corresponding arguments in the
call to the function. For instance, the following function:

bc. (defun foo (a b c) (list a b c))

has three parameters, a, b, and c, and must be called with three
arguments. But sometimes you may want to write a function that can be
called with varying numbers of arguments. Keyword parameters are one
way to achieve this. A version of foo that uses keyword parameters
might look like this:

bc. (defun foo (&key a b c) (list a b c))

The only difference is the &key at the beginning of the argument
list. However, the calls to this new foo will look quite
different. These are all legal calls with the result to the right of
the:

bc. 
(foo :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) => (1 2 3)
(foo :c 3 :b 2 :a 1) => (1 2 3)
(foo :a 1 :c 3) => (1 NIL 3)
(foo) => (NIL NIL NIL)

As these examples show, the value of the variables a, b, and c are
bound to the values that follow the corresponding keyword. And if a
particular keyword isn’t present in the call, the corre- sponding
variable is set to NIL. I’m glossing over a bunch of details of how
keyword parameters are specified and how they relate to other kinds of
parameters, but you need to know one more detail.

Normally if a function is called with no argument for a particular
keyword parameter, the parameter will have the value NIL. However,
sometimes you’ll want to be able to distinguish between a NIL that was
explicitly passed as the argument to a keyword parameter and the
default value NIL. To allow this, when you specify a keyword parameter
you can replace the simple name with a 

%{color:red}list consisting of the name of% the parameter, a default value, and
another parameter name, called a supplied-p parameter. The supplied-p
parameter will be set to true or false depending on whether an
argument was actually passed for that keyword parameter in a
particular call to the function.

Here’s a version of foo that uses this feature:

bc. (defun foo (&key a (b 20) (c 30 c-p)) (list a b c c-p))

Now the same calls from earlier yield these results:

bc. 
(foo :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) -> (1 2 3 T)
(foo :c 3 :b 2 :a 1) -> (1 2 3 T)
(foo :a 1 :c 3) -> (1 20 3 T)
(foo) -> (NIL 20 30 NIL)

h3. Define a variable (with DEFVAR macro)

bc. (defvar *data* nil)

h3. cddr

The cddr command chops the first two item from the front of the list (so only the path data remains). 

h2. String functions

h3. EQUAL

The function EQUAL, when given string arguments, compares them
character by character

So @(equal (getf cd :artist) "Dixie Chicks")@ will test whether the
artist field of a given CD is equal to "Dixie Chicks"


h3. Loading a file full of lisp

bc. (load "myFunctions.lisp")

h3. Load defun into lisp 

(do anywhere in or immediately after defun)

bc. C-c C-c

h3. Switch to the REPL

bc. C-c C-z

* Quit

bc. , quit

* Exit the debugger

bc. q

* Compile a file, creates "hello.fasl" (FASt Load)

bc. (compile-file "hello.lisp")

* Compile and load the file in the current buffer

bc. C-c C-k

* Make a list function, constructs a list from its arguments

bc. (list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)

* A plist or property list (like a hash map) contains key=>value pairs. A plist is a list where every other element, starting with the first, is a symbol that describes what the next element in the list is. A keyword is any name that starts with a colon (:), for instance, :foo. 

bc. (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)

* The function GETF, which takes a plist and a symbol and returns the value in the plist following the symbol

bc. (GETF (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) :a)
(1)
