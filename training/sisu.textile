Here is a simple tutorial on how to use SISU markup.  

h1. Environment

I recommend using a Debian distribution of Linux.  Ubuntu is what I'm using now.

h1. Tutorial

This tutorial will start small assuming very little background knowledge.

h2. Demo

Create a text file called @test.sst@ with the following contents:

bc.. 
% SiSU 0.57

@title: SISU
 :subtitle: A Simple Tutorial

:A~ @title

:1~ Heading Level 1

This is the first section.  Lets add a subsection.

:2~ Here is the subsection title

This is the subsection text.  Lets add another level 1 heading.

:1- 2nd Level 1 Heading

The paragraph is here.

h2. Process File

After you have typed the above into a file called @test.sst@ you 
can now process that file with the following command:

bc. 
sisu -p test.sst

This should create a folder called @sisu_www@ in your home directory.
Under this folder there will be another two folders of the format @<username>/<filename>@
since my username is @ftravers@ and the filename of the sisu document
is @test.sst@, I now have the following folders: @~/sisu_www/ftravers/test/@ inside
this folder I can find several pdf files which is what the @-p@ argument to the 
sisu command means...create PDF's for me.
