* Setup OAuth2 with Google

First you have to setup a project with google:

https://code.google.com/apis/console/?pli=1

There you will get your client ID, here we'll use:

: 1010265353588-to2pjmgge2oceivlsbdc17e8dgq64hfa.apps.googleusercontent.com

On your webpage you can have a link to:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth
? response_type = token
& client_id = 1010265353588-to2pjmgge2oceivlsbdc17e8dgq64hfa.apps.googleusercontent.com
& nonce
& redirect_uri
#+END_SRC
