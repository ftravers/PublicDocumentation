: ~abc~

* Debugger

Instrument your function with:

: C-u C-A-x

SPC key to next through statements, result displayed in mini-buffer

: q

: h - go Here
here. move to where you want emacs to stop (like breakpoint), press
'h' and when code hits that spot it will stop there.

: g - go
evaluate to the end of the function without quitting

: b
breakpoint

: G
go, dont stop at breakpoints

: i
go into sub-function. remains instrumented. re-eval func to
un-instrument.
