* Learning

** Dragan Rocks

** 7 Gate

* Notes

** Linear Regression - AKA least squares

** Linearly Separable

You can draw a line between two sets of data

** KNN - x nearest neighbors
just save all the data into the database and future queries lookup to
closest value and k neighbours to figure out what answer should be.

** Cross Validation

Shuffle the dataset randomly.
Split the dataset into k groups
For each unique group:
Take the group as a hold out or test data set
Take the remaining groups as a training data set
Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores
