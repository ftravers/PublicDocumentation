* Widgets

** Basic Widgets (text,edit,buttons,dividers)
Text: For displaying text
Edit: For editing text
Buttons:
Divider: separate widgets from each other.

** Widget Types (box, flow and fixed)
*** Flow (for text, fixed columns only)

The best way to display text is to have it flow from one screen row to
the next. Widgets like this that require a variable number of screen
rows are called flow widgets.

*** Box (fixed row/columns)
** Decoration Widgets (padding, filler, attrmap)
Padding/Filler (vertical/horizontal) or other way around???
** Container Widgets (columns, pile, frame, listbox)


* Attributes

attributes add colors from the palette to a widget.
palette = [('banner', 'black', 'light gray')]
txt = urwid.Text(u" Hello World ")
map1 = urwid.AttrMap(txt, 'banner')
