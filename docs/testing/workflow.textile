h2. Workflow plus two step contribution

h3. Description

Initially we had a problem where a contributor of OpenWCM would create a new item in the Announcement Listing but when they tried to edit the new item they couldn't because it was in a workflow.  We then inserted a 'Contribution' step at the beginning of the workflow that took the author to be the reviewer as well.  This now allows us to contribute and edit the document all at once.

h3. Test Steps

# Go to the "FAQ announcements page":../Design/OpenWCM.html#faq page.
# Select _Edit Page_. 
# !images/01_select_edit.gif!
# This will take you to the OpenWCM contributor page, here type Ctrl-Shift-F5 to enter contributor mode. 
# At this point log in as our contributor: _sysadmin_.
# Select the pencil icon to go into the Dynamic List editor.
# !images/02_pencilIcon.gif!
# In the dynamic list editor click the add new item icon.
# !images/03_addNewItem.gif!

# !images/08_secondaryPage.gif!
# Since sysadmin is the contributor check sysadmins email for a notification of contribution.
# !!!!! put in the rest of the steps once the worklist is available !!!!!
# After the contributor approves their own material the item will go to the Reviewer step and in this case that is the _taa_ user, check their email to see the email notification indicating they need to review the checked in item.
# !!!!! put in more for the worklist steps when available !!!!!
# Have the _taa_ user approve the content and see that the Approver _tac_ gets an email to their email address.
