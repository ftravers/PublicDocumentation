This letter is your official one month notice to vacate the property
at: 

\begin{quote}
1529 East 19th Avenue,
Vancouver, B.C., Canada
V5N 2T8
\end{quote}

You shall vacate the property on or before:

\begin{quote}
December 5, 12:00 (noon)
\end{quote}

As it is sometimes confusing regarding habitation rights, please refer
to sections 1a \& 4c the RESIDENTIAL TENANCY ACT. These sections
indicate that when you live with the `Owners Agent', your habitation
is not covered by the act.

Your damage deposit will be refunded to you in full on the vacation
date and time specified above under the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Your room is in the same state of cleanliness and condition as
  when you moved in.
\item All keys provided to you are surrendered.  If you have lost
  keys, a \$20.00 penalty will be levied for the labour and material
  costs of duplicating the key.
\end{itemize}
