This letter authorizes Margaret Squires, act on my behalf in relation
to the Legal Notice, supplied by the City of Vancouver on November 6,
2010.  This is the Legal Notice with I.R. No. UI 43979/EN 065252.

One of the issues she is authorized to act on my behalf is, (but not
limited to), as follows:

Resolving working with two groups at the Vancouver City Hall
over two matters which will have over-lapping consequences.  These are
the application for a Secondary Suite and the Legal Notice referred to
above and it's order to restore the interconnect between the basement
and the main floor of the house.
