OVM Manager Setup 

* Details

	Instructions on how to create an oracle template builder and oracle VM manager
	virtual machine.

	To simplify the process use these instructions to to build an Oracle Enterprise Linux VM Guest inside of either Virtual Box or VM Ware.  This way you can follow these directions on your home PC, Mac or laptop.

** Create a guest VM

*** Download ISO

	Download the latest version of Oracle Enterprise Linux from edelivery.oracle.com

*** Create VM

	Create a guest VM in the normal way for VM Ware or Virtual Box.  However make sure to make the network adapter a
	<bridged> network adaptor.

	If you have some problems, as I did on Ubuntu 10.04, you can simply rebuild the kernel network drivers as shown in the image.
	
	../images/vbox_rebuild_network_kernel_module.png	
	
	When install Oracle Enterprise Linux into the VM, accept all defaults



	It's nice to have a static IP so you can SSH into the VM Guest
	
	This is a little bit of a cheat because I think you would need to build it first in VM Ware.  
	Then once you've got it in VMWare you can build a JeOS
	from there with these instructions again and then you'll have a JeOS version 
	and can delete the VM Ware version.

	Put a proper yum file in /etc/yum.repos.d, so we can download from the yum repositories
	Get it from: http://public-yum.oracle.com/public-yum-el5.repo Change all the enabled=0 to 
	enabled=1
	
	Setup DNS servername in /etc/resolv.conf by adding line:
	nameserver 192.168.8.1
	
	RPM Pre-Requisits
	[root@localhost tmp]# yum install -y bzip2 createrepo parted perl
	
	Oracle XE DB Prerequisits
	[root@localhost disk]# yum install -y libaio bc
	
*** JeOS TEMPLATES
	
	Setting up the JeOS templates you can use for future OS image construction
	
	Download the JeOS RPM files from eDelivery.oracle.com/linux: 
	Product Pack: Enterprise Linux, Platform: 64 bit, 
	Description: Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS for Building Oracle VM templates for x86_64 (64 bit), 
	Names:
	
	    * JeOS Base x86 and x86_64
	
	    * JeOS Enterprise Linux 5 Update 3 base image x86_64 (64 Bit)
	
	<NOTE> Now will add the 32 bit as well, because want VM's to be playable on the most infrastructures possible.  Still some 32bit machines out there!
	
	Install them with:
	
+--- 
	[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# rpm -ivh ovm-modify-jeos-1.1.0-2.el5.noarch.rpm
	[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# rpm -ivh ovm-el5u3-xvm-jeos-1.1.0-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
+---
	
	REBOOT to see changes.
	
	Install the OVM Template Builder pre-requisits
	
+--- 
[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# yum install â€“y python-simplejson.x86_64 python-sqlite2.x86_64 Django.noarch ovmtb ovmtb-images
[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# service httpd restart
[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# service ovmtb restart
[root@ovmmanager yum.repos.d]# system-config-securitylevel-tui --quiet --port=http --port=ssh
+---

	Hit: http://192.168.8.120/ovmtb, register, and log in. You should be good to go now with OVM Template
	Builder.

tmpfs                 256M     0  256M   0% /dev/shm

Swap:  1052248k total,        0k used,  1052248k free,   306436k cached
+---
	
	Now lets get OVM Manager installed:

+---	
[root@localhost mnt]# mkdir /mnt/disk
[root@localhost Desktop]# mount -o loop OracleVM-Manager-2.1.5.iso /mnt/disk
[root@localhost Desktop]# cd /mnt/disk
[root@localhost disk]# sh runInstaller.sh
+---	
	
*** Get rid of the firewall
	
+--- 
[root@localhost ~]# chkconfig --del iptables
[root@localhost ~]# chkconfig --del ip6tables
[root@localhost ~]# service iptables stop
[root@localhost ~]# service ip6tables stop
+---
	
	Go to the following URL and login as 'admin' pw: 'welcome1' (or whatever you set):
	http://192.168.8.120:8888/OVS/faces/infrastructure/OVS_Login.jspx
	
	Next you'll have to create a server pool from one or more OVM Servers.  Provide
	the server IP and agent password plus root password.  If there are VM's on the 
	server you can import them so you can see them in the manager.
