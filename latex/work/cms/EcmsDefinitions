Placeholder definitions 

Files that define what region definitions, region templates, and
subtemplates are allowed for the associated placeholders. They also
specify what contributor actions are allowed for the placeholders.

A placeholder is no more than an insertion point (a tag) on a page
template to identify where there is a contribution region (that is,
editable area) on the web page. What that contribution region contains
and what it looks like is defined using region templates and region
definitions. A page template may contain multiple placeholders. There
are no files associated with placeholders; that is, there are no
"placeholder files" on the content server. Placeholders are controlled
by placeholder definitions, which specify what content can go in the
contribution region and how it is displayed, as well the actions
available to contributors (for example, switching content or modifying
metadata). A placeholder contains either one subtemplate or one region
template.}}
