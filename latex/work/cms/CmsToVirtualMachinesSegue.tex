previous content management system (CMS) topics, the overall
motivation for the information provided here, is to give you the basis
for actually implementing and using the entire architecture that is
presented.
	
To do this on the small budget I'm assuming you have, it is necessary
to leverage Virtual Machine technology.  So lets get that topic under
our belt.
