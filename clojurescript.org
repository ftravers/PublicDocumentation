* Access Object Properties

To access an objects properties (including functions you want as a
value) use a leading dash:

Here the object `navigator` has a property `geolocation` access like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojurescript
(.-geolocation js/navigator)
#+END_SRC

* Geolocation

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
#+END_SRC

To access an objects properties (including functions you want as a
value) use a leading dash:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojurescript
(.getCurrentPosition (.-geolocation js/navigator) (fn [pos] (put! out pos)))
#+END_SRC

data_tables.core.main();
(.main (-.core js/data_tables))
* Debugging

In the browser console you can access your objects via:

(1) change dashes (-) to underscores (_)

So in ns: pcbe-web.views.debug we have a def:

(def cljs-repl-atom (atom ""))

In console as we type, there will be autocompletion
