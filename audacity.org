* Remove noise from a recording.

When recording you should allow some silence before and after the
recording.

+ Select a portion of the recording before or after that contains just
the background noise.

+ Effects > Noise Removal

+ Get Profile

+ Now select the part of the recording you want to keep (and apply
  noise removal to)

+ Effects > Noise Removal

+ Preview > OK

Then I like to cut and paste this out by:

+ C-x

+ Delete the existing recording (x in top left)

+ C-v

* Playback

Using the `sox` package.
